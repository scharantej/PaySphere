## **Flask Application Design for PayPal Store**

### **HTML Files**

1. **index.html**
   - Homepage of the store, displaying products and categories.
   - Includes a navigation bar with links to browse products and categories, and a login form.
2. **product_detail.html**
   - Shows the details of a specific product, including images, description, and add-to-cart button.
3. **cart.html**
   - Displays the user's shopping cart, listing the products and their quantities.
   - Contains a checkout button to initiate the payment process.
4. **login.html**
   - Allows users to log in to their PayPal account to make purchases.
5. **checkout.html**
   - Facilitates the checkout process, including address and payment information.
   - Once payment is complete, it displays a confirmation message.

### **Routes**

1. **@app.route('/')**
   - Displays the homepage, rendering the `index.html` file.
2. **@app.route('/products')**
   - Shows the list of products, organized by categories.
3. **@app.route('/product/<int:product_id>')**
   - Displays the details of a product, using the product's unique ID.
4. **@app.route('/cart')**
   - Shows the user's shopping cart, allowing them to modify the quantities.
5. **@app.route('/login')**
   - Renders the login form, allowing users to log in with their PayPal account.
6. **@app.route('/checkout')**
   - Handles the checkout process, collecting user's address and payment details.
7. **@app.route('/payment')**
   - Initiates the payment process through PayPal's API.
8. **@app.route('/confirmation')**
   - Displays the confirmation page once the payment is complete.

### **Additional Considerations**

- **Database:** The application could utilize a database to store product and user data.
- **Payment Gateway:** Integrate PayPal's payment gateway to handle secure transactions.
- **Session Management:** Implement session management to track user's shopping cart and login status.
- **Error Handling:** Provide error handling for invalid product IDs, incorrect input, and payment failures.
